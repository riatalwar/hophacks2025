# Frontend-Only Preferences Setup

The Preferences page now works entirely with localStorage - no backend required!

## What Changed

### âœ… Removed Backend Integration
- **No API calls**: All data is stored locally in the browser
- **No server required**: Works completely offline
- **Simplified code**: Removed complex API service layer
- **Faster performance**: No network requests needed

### âœ… Dynamic UI with Static Backend
- **Real-time updates**: UI changes immediately when you interact with settings
- **Auto-save**: Changes are automatically saved to localStorage
- **Loading states**: Visual feedback during save operations
- **Error handling**: Graceful error handling for localStorage issues

## How It Works

### Data Storage
All preferences are stored in browser localStorage with these keys:
- `classCatcher_preferences` - Complete preferences object
- `classCatcher_theme` - Theme setting (dark/light)
- `classCatcher_accentColor` - Selected accent color

### Auto-Save System
- **Debounced saves**: Prevents excessive localStorage writes
- **100ms delay**: Waits for user to finish making changes
- **Visual feedback**: Shows loading state during saves
- **Error handling**: Displays errors if localStorage fails

### Data Persistence
- **Survives page refresh**: All settings are restored on page load
- **Survives browser restart**: Data persists between sessions
- **Per-browser storage**: Each browser maintains its own settings
